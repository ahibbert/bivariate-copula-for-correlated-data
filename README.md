# bivariate-copula-for-correlated-data

# Introduction

This project provides all code used for the paper 'Copula based joint regression models for correlated data: an analysis in the bivariate case' written by Aydin Sareff-Hibbert and Gillian Z. Heller.

# Overview

This project contains the following components:
1. The code used to generate datasets and fit models for simlations presented in the paper, 'Simulations - 1 - Generate and Fit Models.R' and 'Simulations - 2 - Plot Models.R'.
2. The code used to fit a single model, used for a single applications case and for spot checking by the reader, 'Examples - Applications and Simulation.R'
3. Miscellaneous code used for figures and various calculations denoted 'Ref - XX' 
4. Most main pieces of code rely on common functions provided by 'common_functions.R'
